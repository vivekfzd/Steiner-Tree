# Steiner-Tree
**Steiner Spanning Tree:** A Steiner spanning tree is a spanning tree that connects a set of terminal vertices in a tree so that the total edge weight is minimal.

In this research paper, They have provided a simple algorithrm to find the Steiner Spanning Tree.

I have implemented this algorithm in c++.
